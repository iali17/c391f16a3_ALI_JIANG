We will create one table which has 4 things in it:
	1. Subject
	2. Predicate
	3. Object
	4. Literal

To create this table we can use:
	CREATE TABLE data (
	subject text, predicate text, object text, literal text);

We get all the text until we find a " ."(a period not surrounded by anything). 
This will contain a whole "line". We then seperate the each line by "," or ";".
We parse the first part of this line, get the subject, predicate and
the first object by seperating by white space. Then if it is a "," 
we keep the subject and predicate and assign the object into a new row. If it 
is a ";" we change the predicate and assign the object into a new row. When
assigning a new object we have to check if they define a literal. When we start
literal is defined as "text" (default). If they define a literal we change that
literal to whatever they specify. If our object does not have a prefix and no literal
we have to check if it as int or float. If it is one of those we change literal to 
int or float respectively. When this process is complete we add all these together 
into a string which can be added to the database(comma seperated). We then append 
this string onto a list which contains all the data to be added to the database.
We then loop over this list, open the database file, and load them into the database.

When we are assigning or changing anything we check if it contains a prefix
by checking for ":", if it does we change that variable to prefix + variable.
