Indices depends on how large the database is and how much it gets updated.
They will make parsing a large database faster and makes adding new 
entries slower because we have to update indices. We chose not to  
add indices for this assignment because the database is 
fairly small. Therefore, the indices will not provide a noticable
increase in efficency and speed of query results.


If however we assume that the database is as large as dbpedia,
we should add an index on (subject,predicate) because this would
allow us to parse through the objects faster. Specifically subject
first because we believe that the subject related queries would be 
of higher related frequency.
