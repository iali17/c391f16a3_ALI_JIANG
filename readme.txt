Question 2:
	This gets the airports and checks if it has a location first
	then a city it serves, then a city. This order was intentional
	it gets the most airports with the right city. Even still 
	for some reason some of the cities like "Yellowknife" does not
	have the schema:City in one if its rdf:type. So I don't know
	how to get those.

Question 6:
	Please use tab-size 8 to be able to see the graph as intended.
